    This website is intended to house all of the necessary information I need to play Stardew Valley. 
    The goal of this is to keep all the information I frequently need in one place, so I'm not constantly having to Google the same questions over and over again.
    Some of the things included here are character specific preferences, building material lists, craft and cooking recipes. 
    All information here currently relates to version 1.5 of the game. 
    <br> This is <u><i> NOT </i></u> affliated with the game, the production company, or ConcernedApe and is strictly just a personal reference guide.
